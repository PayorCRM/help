# Setting up Automated statements

Unlike Invoice Reminders , Automated statements feature allows you to set up rules to send an aggregated list of all invoices that are open as of a particular day               \( For e.g : First day of the month , Every Tuesday of a week etc\)



**Difference between Invoice reminders & Statement reminders**

**Invoice reminders** - These are reminders sent based on trigger events such as - "invoice due in x days" or "invoice overdue by y days"

For e.g - Send invoice reminders for invoices that are due in 5 days

**Statement reminders** - These are reminders sent based on a trigger event such as "Day of the week" or "Day of the month" .

For e.g - Send all open invoices on the 1st day of every month
