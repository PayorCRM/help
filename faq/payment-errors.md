# Payment Errors

## Token Error / Invalid Token

Pay with xxxxxx card  / Pay with xxxxx bank account links are one time use links . You will be seeing this error if you click these links multiple times. 

If you did not receive a confirmation email after clicking the links the first time you could do the following

*  Wait for a few minutes for the confirmation email to arrive
* Pay using "PAY WITH NEW CARD "  or "PAY WITH NEW BANK ACCOUNT" link in the email as these links do not expire.



##  Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
