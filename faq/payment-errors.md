# Email Payment Link Errors

## Invalid Token

The Confirmation link has been used recently (in the last 5 minutes). The link can be re-used after 5 minutes.

The 5 minutes window ensures that the last payment processing has been completed.

## Invoice paid /Payment already made

&#x20;If you see this error message, It is a confirmation that the payment has already been made for that particular set of invoices.

## **Unknown Error**

We received an error while processing the payment. Usually the error is due to an issue with your card or bank account. Please check the raw error message received on the screen for details.

If you would like to retry using a different payment method, Use the "Pay with new card" or "Pay with new bank account" buttons in the original email reminder.

If you are still unable to resolve the error reach out to support@payorcrm.com. For some errors we may need to trigger the payment on your behalf to investigate.&#x20;
