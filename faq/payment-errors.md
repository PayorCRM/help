## Token Error / Invalid Token

If you did not receive a confirmation email after clicking the links the first time you could do the following

*  Wait for a few minutes for the confirmation email to arrive
* Pay using "PAY WITH NEW CARD "  or "PAY WITH NEW BANK ACCOUNT" link in the email as these links do not expire.

Please note that the above doesn't mean that the money has been transferred to the merchant.
