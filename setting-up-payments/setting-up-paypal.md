# Setting up PayPal



You will need to create an app in the PayPal account to generate a client ID for your account. 

* Go to the developer PayPal website and create an account or sign in.
* After Sign In, go to [https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/) My Apps & Credentials and click “Create App” button to create an application. Fill in the necessary details and select Create App.
